            <li>0.5 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper together in a large bowl until combined. Form into 8 balls and flatten into patties.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add patties and onion; fry until patties are nicely browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer beef patties to a plate, and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle flour over onions and drippings in the skillet. Stir in flour with a fork, scraping bits of beef off of the bottom of the skillet as you stir. Gradually mix in beef broth and sherry. Season with seasoned salt. Simmer and stir over medium-low heat until gravy thickens, about 5 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Reduce heat to low, return patties to the gravy, cover, and simmer until cooked through, about 15 minutes.</li>
